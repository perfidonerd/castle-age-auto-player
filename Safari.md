# Introduction #

Here is where I tell you that not only is Apple Safari capable of running the CAAP script, but I will tell you how to do it!




# Note #

This will be broke down into two sections PC and MAC. Pay attention to which one you are reading because they are as different as... well, as different as PC and Mac.


# PC Details #

Of course let's take this from the begining.

#1 Assuming that you already have Apple Safari on your computer, skip this step. If you do not have Safari on your computer already, download it for free here: http://www.apple.com/safari/

#2 Now that you have Safari for Windows on your computer, let's talk about extensions. To make CAAP to be able to run on Safari you will first need to download a small program called Ninjakit. You must download Ninjakit from your Safari browser or it will not work.
Download Ninjakit here: http://ss-o.net/safari/extension/NinjaKit.safariextz

#3 This is where things will get slightly difficult. But if you're still here reading this and got this far, I can talk you through it. First go up to your menubar and click on "Edit" then "Preferances". Click on where it says "Extensions" you should now Ninjakit as being listed. If Ninjakit is not listed, you may need to close out of your browser and re-open it.

#4 Now that you have made it this far and you see Ninjakit is listed as a Safari extension, just make sure that the checkbox is checked next to "Enable Ninjakit". You may also notice Ninjakit has a little throwing star icon up next to your address bar. It should place itself there automatically, but depending on your computer and everything, you may have to manually put it there (if you want it). Just click "View" up in your menubar and then click on "Customize Toolbar".

#5 Now that you have (presumably) made it this far, you're well on your way. Now just download the Safari script for CAAP. http://castle-age-auto-player.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Safari/Castle-Age-Autoplayer-Safari.user.js

#6 Now let's test it out and see if you did it right. Open Safari (if already done, close out and re-open Safari. Now visit the Castle Age page and enjoy.
