# Introduction #

Here is where I tell you that not only is Internet Explorer capable of running the CAAP script, but I will tell you how to do it!


# Details #

Of course let's take this from the begining.

#1 Assuming that you are already running a Microsoft Windows computer, you will already have IE (Internet Explorer) on your computer. (For best results download the new version IE9 if you do not already have it.

#2 Now that you have the latest release of IE9 on your computer, let's talk about extensions. To make CAAP to be able to run on IE you will first need to download a small program called IE7Pro. Now, don't let the name fool you, it still works with IE8 and even the current IE9.

#3 This is where things will get slightly difficult. But if you're still here reading this and got this far, I can talk you through it. While the IE7Pro download finishes you will be asked if you would also like to download something called "ProgSense" or something of that effect, tell it NO!

#4 With the download done you may need to close out IE and restart it. Up in the toolbar where it says "File / Edit / ect" it says "Tools". Click on "Tools and in the dropdown menu you should now see "IE7Pro Preferences". Click that to open it. You may get an error saying something along the lines "BHO hasn't been loaded" if you run across this message you may need to only close out of IE and reload it, or you may have to log out of Windows and then log back in (depending on your computer chipset/model/ect.)

#5 After you Are able to open the IE7Pro preferences on the left side you should see where it says "User Scripts". Click that to show you what scripts you have. IE7Pro comes preloaded with several scripts that you have to manually click a checkbox to activate. You can delete all of those, or decide to try them yourself. That is up to you.

#6 Now onto CAAP. To run CAAP on IE you first have to download and save the CAAP file. In IE when you try to download the CAAP file it should open a page that looks like a Microsoft Word document. From the toolbar again, click "File" and "Save As". Save it to somewhere that is easily accessible such as "My Documents". Don't rename the CAAP file, or it may not work.

#7 With the CAAP file saved in My Documents, open My Documents. Now also open "My Computer" as well. In My Computer open your hardrive to show you a file called "Program Files" for 32bit systems OR "Program Files (x86)" for 64bit systems. In your Program Files you should now see a folder for "IE7Pro" open that. Now open the folder "userscripts".

#8 With both "My Documents" and the IE7Pro "userscripts" documents open, simply drag the CAAP file (or copy and paste) into the IE7Pro "userscripts" folder.

#9 Now let's test it out and see if you did it right.
Open IE (if already done, close out and re-open IE)
Go back up to the toolbar and to "Tools" and back to "IE7Pro Preferences". Go back to "User Scripts". You should now see CAAP as being listed. You may have to check the box at the top that says "Enable User Scripts" if not already checked. YOU MUST ENABLE to have CAAP work. Now make sure that CAAP "Castle Age Autoplayer" is checked. Click "OK" and now visit the Castle Age page and enjoy.
