# Introduction #

Here is where I tell you that not only is Opera capable of running the CAAP script, but I will tell you how to do it!


# Code Specifically Wrote For #

Opera 11.64 Internet Browser

# Details #

Of course let's take this from the begining.

#1 Assuming that you already have Opera on your computer, skip this step. If you do not have Opera on your computer already, download it for free here: http://www.opera.com/

#2 Now that you have Opera on your computer, Now lets talk about extensions like Greasemonkey (firefox extension) and such. Opera does not use these to run scripts. So let's move forward.

#3 This is where things will get slightly difficult. But if you're still here reading this and got this far, I can talk you through it. In your Opera browser click on your "Tools" toolbar on the top. A dropdown menu will appear with "Preferences" listed at the bottom of the dropdown menu, click to open your Opera preferences.

#4 Now that you have made it this far and you are in your Opera Preferences, you will see a list of tabs."General / Forms / ect" click the tab that says "Advanced". In the Advanced section, on the left side of the Preferences box, click on where it says "Content". Make sure that "Enable Java Script" is checked. Then click where it says "Java Script Options" on the right.

#5 When you click on the Opera release on the home page, it will pop up a box that says ""Install Extension" where you click install or ignore. Of course, ignoring will cancel the install. After you click install, a box on the lower right hand corner of the screen should appear telling you that CAAP has been installed and was installed correctly.

#6 Now let's test it out and see if you did it right. Open Opera (if already done, close out and re-open Opera). Now visit the Castle Age page and enjoy.
