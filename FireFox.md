# Introduction #

Here is where I tell you that not only is Mozilla Firefox capable of running the CAAP script, but I will tell you how to do it!

# Code Specifically Wrote For #

Firefox 12.0


# Details #
# Script Method #

Of course let's take this from the begining.

#1 Assuming that you already have Mozilla Firefox on your computer, skip this step. If you do not have Firefox on your computer already, download it for free here: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/

#2 Now that you have Mozilla Firefox on your computer, let's talk about extensions. To make CAAP to be able to run on Mozilla Firefox you will first need to download a small program called Greasemonkey. You must download Greasmonkey from your Firefox browser or it will not work.
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/

Should be noted, that to move on to number 3, you must close out of all currently open Firefox browsers, windows, tabs, ect. Then restart Firefox.

#3 This is where things will get slightly difficult. But if you're still here reading this and got this far, I can talk you through it. if you look on the bottom of the screen in the lower right hand corner you should see a little monkey head. If you do not see this, you may have your "Add-On Bar" hidden. To show your add-on bar just simply go up to your toolbar and click the "view" toolbar. A drop-down box will show up and you should see the "Toolbar" menu that when hovered over will show the "Add-On Bar" just click that to show a bar go across the bottom of the page. In that bar is where you will see the monkey head.

#4 Now that you have made it this far and you see the Greasemonkey monkey head, just make sure the monkey head is coloured in and if right clicked on a menubox will appear that at the bottom option will say "Enabled" just make sure that it is enabled or your scripts will not run.

#5 Now that you have (presumably) made it this far, you're well on your way. Now just download the Firefox script for CAAP. http://castle-age-auto-player.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Castle-Age-Autoplayer.user.js

#6 Now let's test it out and see if you did it right. Open Firefox (if already done, close out and re-open Firefox) Go back up to the toolbar on the bottom with the monkey head. Right click on the monkey head again. You should now see CAAP listed as "Castle Age Autoplayer" and it should have a checkbox in front of it. If it does not have a checkbox, just click on it to check it. Now visit the Castle Age page and enjoy.
(you can hide the lower menubar again if you would like)

# XPi Method #

Of course let's take this from the begining.

#1 Assuming that you already have Mozilla Firefox on your computer, skip this step. If you do not have Firefox on your computer already, download it for free here: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/

#2 Now that you have Mozilla Firefox on your computer, let's talk about extensions. Such as the GreaseMonkey extension listed above... It is not needed, however using an XPi can cause problems later down the road with Firefox updates, the XPi will become "incompatible with firefox" version upgrade.

#3 To get the current XPi download it here:

#4 Now test it and see if it works. Visit your  Castle Age page and enjoy.
